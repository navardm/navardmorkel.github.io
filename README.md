the website makes use of a image slider as a general background on most of the pages.

the website portfolio makes use of icons in place of a normal menu list, it has a transition animation for navigation between various links.
The static site consists of a Home page(index) that can be visited via the logo which serves as the clickable link to the home page. An information
page that navigates to the about page that just gives a brief description to the skills that i have aquired within the development space. A linkedin icon
is part of the menu that redirects the website to my personal linkedin profile and then a contact page that presents the visitor with ways and means to contact me.

adjustments within the css styling has been made to help with responsiveness when viewing site on a smaller device.
